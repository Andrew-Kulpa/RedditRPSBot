# RedditRPSBot
This bot was a follow-up explanation in a tutorial I ran in 
Western Illinois University's Computer Science Association.

Many components are pretty standard among Reddit bots, with
obviously the usage of Python importing PRAW components to
reference Reddit components.

Any questions or comments may be directed towards me @
aj-kulpa@wiu.edu.
